# telebot

If you want to create a telegram bot follow this steps :

You have to go to telegram and search for Bot father when you find the account message it with a /start command 
After that you send the bot a new command to create a new bot /newbot
 It will ask you the name you want to use and you will have to supply the bot with the name you want your bot to have 
 And you have to do the same when it asks you for your bot username 
 NOTE: Bot username and name are not the same 
 
 After that it will give you your bot API, copy your bot API and paste it on the python file named constants.py.
 Paste the API directly inside the variable in the constants.py file
 and start re-editing and give your bot new commands you want the bot to reply to.
